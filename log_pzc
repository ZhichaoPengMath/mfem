(3) Add practice examples:

(1) Difference between 
	FiniteElementSpace->Update(true) and Update(false)
			use an interpolation		 Not use that
(2) FiniteElementSpace->Update(false) + GridFunction->GetTrueDof( vector )
may calse trouble as the interpolation is not specified, and this may cause
random initialization
What we should do, it is to update the vector size and mannually refine it.

(3) L2_Interface, RT_Trace, H1_Trace may only support Update(false)
